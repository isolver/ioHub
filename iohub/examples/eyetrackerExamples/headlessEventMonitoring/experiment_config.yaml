#
# Settings related to the experiment being run when the experiment script is launched.
#
# Custom session variables you want displayed in a dialog for input at the start of the experiment
# can be defined in the  session_defaults: user_variables: section.
#
# Configuration settings related to the local Experiment Process the Experiment
# Processcan also be specified.
#
# Custom experiment preferences can also be added, as long as the prefernce name is not 
# a standard ioHub experiment confiuration preference name. For example, adding:
#
#    maximum_experiment_session_time: 120
#
# creates an experiment preference called maximum_experiment_session_time that can be read
# from the ioHubExperimentRuntime class using:
#
#    max_exp_time=self.getConfiguration().get('maximum_experiment_session_time', None)
#    if max_exp_time is None:
#        print 'Sorry, no experiment configuration variable called "maximum_experiment_session_time" was found.'
#    else:
#        print '>> Note: Maximum experiment duration will be ', max_exp_time
#
# You would also need to add the experiment logic to your script to enforce 
# this custom experiment prefernce. ;)
#
# Not all preferences listed here are 'required' when creating an experiment_config.yaml,
# all standard ioHub experiment preferences have default values that will be used
# if the setting is not specified for in given experiments experiment_config.yaml.
# Only fields marked FIELD REQUIRED are 'technically' needed in the experiment_config.
  
# Title you want to give the experiment. 48 char max length please.

# A version string to associate with the experiment. Max 6 chars please.
