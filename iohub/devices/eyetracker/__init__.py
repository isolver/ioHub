    """
    The EyeTrackerDevice class is the main class for the common eye tracker 
    interface API built into ioHub.

    The common eye tracker interface class is implemented for different
    eye tracker models by creating a subclass of the EyeTrackerDevice class
    and implementing the common eye tracker API components that can be supported
    by the given eye tracking hardware. It is these sub classes of the
    EyeTrackerDevice that are used to define which implementation of the 
    common eye tracker interface is to be used during an experiment,
    based on which eye tracker hardware you plan on using.

    Not every eye tracker implementation of the Common Eye Tracker Interface
    will support all of the interface functionality, however a core set of minimum
    functionality is expected to be supported by all implementation. 
    
    Methods in the EyeTrackerDevice class are broken down into several categories
    within the EyeTracker class:

    #. Eye Tracker Initialization / State Setting.
    #. Ability to Define the Graphics Layer for the Eye Tracker to Use During Calibration / System Setup.
    #. Starting and Stopping of Data Recording.
    #. Sending Synchronization messages or codes to the Eye Tracker.
    #. Accessing Eye Tracker Data During Recording.
    #. Accessing the Eye Tracker Timebase.
    #. Synchronizing the ioHub time base with the Eye Tracker time base, so Eye Tracker events can be provided with local time stamps when that is appropriate.

    .. note:: 

        Only **one** instance of EyeTracker can be created within an experiment. Attempting to create > 1
        instance will raise an exception. To get the current instance of the EyeTracker you can call the
        class method EyeTracker.getInstance(); this is useful as it saves needing to pass an eyeTracker
        instance variable around your code.
