class EyeTracker(Device):
    '''EyeTracker class is the main class for the pyEyeTrackerInterface module,
    containing the majority of the eye tracker functionality commonly needed
    for a range of experiments.

    With the integration of the pyEyeTrackerInterface into the ioHub module, the EyeTracker
    device is a device along with the other currently supported ioHub devices; Keyboard, Mouse,
    and Parallel Port.

    For implementers of pyEyeTracker interfaces, this means that the interface itself is running
    in the ioHub process, and communication between the computer and the eyetracker is done via
    the ioHub.

    For users of the pyEyeTrackerInterface for an eye tracker and psychopy, there is a second,
    experiment side ( psychopy side ) interface that has a parallel public API that 'talks'
    to the ioHub server. The good news for users is that this is transparent and you should not
    even realize this is happening in use. The good news for interface developers is that the
    client side interface is dynamically generated at the start-up of the experiment based on the
    server side interface, so you do not need to maintain 2 seperate interfaces or worry about
    keeping them in sync.

    Not every eye tracker implemenation of the pyEyeTrackerInterface specification will
    support all of the specifications functionality. This is to be expected and
    pyEyeTrackerInterface has been designed to handle this case. When a specific
    implementation does not support a given method, if that method is called,
    a default *not supported* behaviour is built into the base implemetation.

    On the other hand, some eye trackers offer very specialized functionality that
    is as common across the eye tracking field so is not part of the pyEyeTrackerInterface core,
    or functionality that is just currently missing from the pyEyeTrackerInterface. ;)

    In these cases, the specific eye tracker implemetation can expose the non core pyEyeTrackerInterace
    functionality for their device by adding extra command types to the
    sendCommand method, or as a last resort, via the *EyeTracker.EXT* attribute of the class.

    .. note::

        Only **one** instance of EyeTracker can be created within an experiment. Attempting to create > 1 instance will raise an exception. To get the current instance of the EyeTracker you can call the class method EyeTracker.getInstance(); this is useful as it saves needing to pass an eyeTracker instance variable around your code.

    Methods are broken down into several categories within the EyeTracker class:

    #. Eye Tracker Initalization / State Setting
    #. Ability to Define the Graphics Layer for the Eye Tracker to Use During Calibration / System Setup
    #. Starting and Stopping of Data Recording
    #. Sending Syncronization messages to the Eye Tracker
    #. Accessing the Eye Tracker Timebase
    #. Accessing Eye Tracker Data During Recording
    #. Syncronizing the Local Experiment timebase with the Eye Tracker Timebase, so Eye Tracker events can be provided with local time stamps when that is appropriate.
    #. Experiment Flow Generics

    Developers of eye tracker interfaces for CETI can extend this class and implement
    the specifics necessary to have the eye tracker perform whatever functionality is
    supported by the eye tracker in terms of user facing graphics for these types of tasks.

    * Users 'enter' the graphics mode provided by the EyeTrackerUserCalibrationGraphics class by
      calling a method of the eyetracker object from their experiment script:

      runSetupProcedure(*args,**kwargs):

      which in turn calls the run(....) method the this class.

    * This call blocks the user script, handing over control of the graphics state to the eye tracker interface.
      The user script will remain blocked until you call the objects returnToUserSpace() method, or the user
      manages to call the eyetracker.stopSetupProcedure() method.

    * Devlopers can access keyboard and mouse events occurring on the experiment computer by calling:

      events = getKeyboardMouseEvents() # returns all keyboard and mouse events since
                                        # the last call or since the last time
