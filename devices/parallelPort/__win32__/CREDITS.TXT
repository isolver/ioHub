Thanks to Nate Vack for posting the solution he found for getting pport to work on win64 that does not use the
"free for personal use" dll my other solution required.

From Nate's post, to do the one time driver install required:

1) Download the drivers and DLLs from http://www.highrez.co.uk/Downloads/InpOut32/default.htm
   -- the ones from http://www.logix4u.net/parallel-port/26-inpoutx64dll-for-win-xp-64-bit
   might work as well (I think this is the genuine source) but the driver installer executable
   in the highrez package is nice.
2) Extract the zip and run Win32/InstallDriver.exe -- this will prompt for admin access
