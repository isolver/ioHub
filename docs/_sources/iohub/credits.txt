The ioHub project is being developed for use by the `COGAIN Technical Committee on Eye Data Quality <http://www.cogain.org/info/eye-data-quality/>'_ on a volenteer basis by iSolver Solftware Solutions.
The hope is that the package will also serve as a useful open source and free resource for the psychology and eye tracking research community in general. 

I would like to acknowledge all the hard work that the volunteers of the committee membership have been contributing toward the COGAIN Technical committees' overall goals.

The following people (listed alphabetically) have contributed to and/or are continuing to contribute to the ioHub implementation. Their help and participation is greatly appreciated and without it we would not be were we are today.

* **Josh Borah** - A.S.L. - Sudo code implementation of physical unit to various eye angle measures.
* **QIAN Chencan** - Chinese Academy of Sciences - testing and user feedback on ioHub, including excellent testing, input, and discussion on timing related matters.
* **Kenneth Holmqvist** - Lund University - input on design of the pyEyeTrackerInterface and the ioHub - Ongoing
* **Markus Joos** - Interactive Minds - LC Technologies Eye Tracker Implementation for the pyEyeTrackerInterface - Ongoing
* **Michael MacAskill** - University of Otago - Contributed a python wrapper of much of the SMI UDP interface at the very beginning of the pyEyeTracker (as it was then called) project, as the intent at that time was to do the interface for the SMI systems using the popular UDP interface. As it turned out, SMI themselves stepped up to the plate to implement an interface for the pyEyeTrackerInterface before any other volunteer(s) were available to take on this task and decided to use ctypes and their C DLL for it. Therefore the donated code has not been used to date, but the gesture was greatly appreciated and I hope the code remains available to the project should it ever be needed.
* **Fiona Mulvey** - Lund University - input on functional requirements for the pyEyeTrackerInterface and the ioHub for the eye tracker standardization committee
* **Florian Niefind** and **Jan Hoffmann** - SMI - SMI Eye Tracker Implementation for the pyEyeTrackerInterface - Ongoing
* **Jeff Pelz** - R.I.T. - Ongoing input on functional priorities, eye tracker integration,  and active 'real lab use' test site.
* **Gian David Perrone** - IT University of Copenhagen - Github project setup.
* **Dong Wang** - R.I.T. - Ongoing input on system functionality and testing support (thank you).

I would also like to extend a big thank you to [Jonathan Pierce](http://www.psychology.nottingham.ac.uk/research/vision/jwp/home.html), creator of [PsychoPy](http://www.psychopy.org), who has been kind enough to provide me with feedback on the ioHub specifications but, to me more importantly, invaluable input on the great world of open-source projects and his experience working within it. I really can not say enough about how much his input has meant to me and how much it is appreciated. You are a genuine scholar and teacher Jon, thank you. This thanks is extended to the psychopy developer and user group as a whole; many members of which have made important points and debate that I always find informative and useful. Thank you.

It is also so important to thank and recognize all the incredible open source Python packages and modules that the ioHub use to do what it does. Without the hard work of these project teams, this project would not exist either. I will be adding more details on each project in the near future, but for now, you can view the list of great projects we are thankful for by viewing the [installation section](https://github.com/isolver/ioHub/wiki/ioHub-install) of the wiki.

Thank you

Sol
