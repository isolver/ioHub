Experiment Runtime Utility Classes and Functions
##################################################

The ioHub.util section of the ioHub package contains various Classes and functions
aimed at making it easier to code using ioHub and PsychoPy together within a scripting
development environemnt.

Other than the ioHubExperimentRuntime class, most of the experiment runtime 
utilities provided by the ioHub package are *in progress* higher level experiment
building blocks for use when scripting an experiment. 
The API for these utilities may change in the future and backwards compatibility is 
not yet a consern of this area of the API. Through more actual use and feedback the
utilities classes will likely evolve into, what will hopefully be, a better, more
complete and more consistent, set of code.
