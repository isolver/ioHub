Dialog Utility Classes
#######################

PyschoPy has an excellent set of dialog fucntions that can be used to display
GUI dialog windows of various types prior to openning the full screen window
for your experiment stimulus. The dialogs contained here offer slightly different
fucntionailty than is offered by the psychopy equivalent, or adds new dialog types,
like the ProgressBarDialog class. If it makes sense, perhaps some of the changes
or additions made here should be incorperated into the PsychoPy project proper.
