ioHub Documentation and API Specification
##########################################

The ioHub is a Python package that allows the seperation of experiment device
input processing (for devices such as keyboard, mouse, eye tracker, analog, TTL,
serial, etc) from the main experiment logic (stimulus presentation, experiment design logic, etc.). 

ioHub handles reading device inputs and converting the inputs into common event types
based on device type, regardless of the underlying hardware. Events are time stamped 
when it is not done by the source device itself, or existing device event
time stamps are converted to a common timebase (ioHub time) and, when possible, 
delay and drift factors between the input device clock and the ioHub clock are 
corrected for.

ioHub also provides a common event access API for real-time event monitoring as
well as providing transparent storage of all events received for future retieval and 
analysis.  

The ioHub clock can be used to get the current time at any point during experiment
execution, making it easy to integrate and relate event time stamps to other 
experiment based events. Experiment Messages can be sent to the ioHub as
events themselves and saved with all other event data recorded during an experiment,
making post hoc analysis of experiment and input device events simple yet powerful.

While the ioHub package handles device input processing and communication, 
the main experiment logic is handled by a seperate experiment creation and 
runtime package, namely the most excellent open source PsychoPy.
