Using the PsychoPy Coder *Extra's* API
=================================================================

**THIS PAGE IS NOT COMPLETE AND WILL BE UPDATED WITHIN 72 HOURS**

The iohub.util submodule of the ioHub Framework contains various classes and functions
that add some optional functionality to the PsychoPy API. This area of fucntionality is
*experimental* and will be adjusted as there is time consider any feadback received.

Therefore the API for this section of the API is likely to change in the future and 
backwards compatibility is not yet a main consern of this area of the API. 
Some of the fucntionality may eventually be merged with PsychoPy itself,
or replaced in favor of a better option that has become apparent through use and feedback.
