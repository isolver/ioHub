Using the Experiment Runtime Utility Classes and Functions
=================================================================

The iohub.util submodule of the ioHub Framework contains various classes and functions
aimed at making it easier to code using ioHub and PsychoPy together within a scripting
development environemnt.

These fucntionality defined within this section of the ioHub Package is
*in progress* higher level experiment runtime *helper* code. The API for these utilities
may change in the future and backwards compatibility is not yet a main consern of this
area of the API. Some of the fucntionality may eventually be merged with PsychoPy itself,
or replaced in favor of a better option that has become apparent through use and feedback.
