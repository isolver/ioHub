Keyboard:
    # name: The name you want to assign the keyboard device for the experiment
    #   This name is what will be used to access the device within the experiment
    #   script via the devices.[device_name] property of the ioHubConnection or
    #   ioHubExperimentRuntime classes.
    #
    name: keyboard

    # enable: Specifies if the device should be enabled by ioHub and monitored
    #   for events.
    #   True = Enable the device on the ioHub Server Process
    #   False = Disable the device on the ioHub Server Process. No keyboard events will
    #   be reported by the ioHub Server.

    # saveEvents: *If* the ioHubDataStore is enabled for the experiment, then
    #   indicate if events for this device should be saved to the
    #   monitor_event_types: Specified which KeyboardEvent types should be monitored
    #   for and therefore saved to the DataStore or sent to the Experiment Process.

    #   during experiment runtime to the Experiment / PsychoPy Process.

    # auto_report_events: Indicate if events from this device should start being
    #   processed by the ioHub as soon as the device is loaded at the start of an experiment,
    #   or if events should only start to be monitored on the device when a call to the
    #   device's enableEventReporting method is made with a parameter value of True.
    #   True = Automatically start reporting events for this device when the experiment starts.
    #   False = Do not start reporting events for this device until enableEventReporting(True)
    #       is set for the device during experiment runtime.

    # event_buffer_length: Specify the maximum number of events (for each
    #   event type the device produces) that can be stored by the ioHub Server

    #   discarded from the ioHub device event buffer.
