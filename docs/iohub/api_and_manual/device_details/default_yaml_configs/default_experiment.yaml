Experiment:
    # name: The unique name to assign to the evice instance created.
    #   The device is accessed from within the PsychoPy script 
    #   using the name's value; therefore it must be a valid Python
    #   variable name as well.
    #

    # monitor_event_types: Specify which of the device's supported event
    #   types you would like the ioHub to monitor for.
    #
    monitor_event_types: [MessageEvent, LogEvent]

    # enable: Specifies if the device should be enabled by ioHub and monitored
    #   for events.
    #   True = Enable the device on the ioHub Server Process
    #   False = Disable the device on the ioHub Server Process. No events for
    #   this device will be reported by the ioHub Server.

    # saveEvents: *If* the ioHubDataStore is enabled for the experiment, then
    #   indicate if events for this device should be saved to the
    #   data_collection/keyboard event group in the hdf5 event file.

    # streamEvents: Indicate if events from this device should be made available
    #   during experiment runtime to the PsychoPy Process.

    # auto_report_events: Indicate if events from this device should start being
    #   processed by the ioHub as soon as the device is loaded at the start of an experiment,
    #   or if events should only start to be monitored on the device when a call to the
    #   device's enableEventReporting method is made with a parameter value of True.
    #   True = Automatically start reporting events for this device when the experiment starts.
    #   False = Do not start reporting events for this device until enableEventReporting(True)
    #   is set for the device during experiment runtime.

    auto_report_events: True

    # event_buffer_length: Specify the maximum number of events (for each
    #   event type the device produces) that can be stored by the ioHub Server
    #   before each new event results in the oldest event of the same type being
    #   discarded from the ioHub device event buffer.
