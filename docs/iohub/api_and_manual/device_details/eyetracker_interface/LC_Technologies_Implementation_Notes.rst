LC EyeGaze EyeTracker Implementation
##################################################

**Platforms:** Windows
    
**Supported Models:**

* All LC EyeGaze Eye Tracking Systems should work.
* testing has been doing using a monocular, head fixed, model running in single computer mode only.

.. note:: Please see the outstanding issues section at the bottom of this page regarding 
    an important unresolved issue related to Eyegaze Sample time stamp conversion to ioHub time.
    Although gaze data appears to be spatially accurate, the sample event time stamps are unusable
    due to large errors in the current native device to ioHub time base conversions.

Installing other Necessary LC EyeGaze Software
##################################################

The LC EyeGaze implementation of the ioHub Common Eye Tracker Interface uses the 
LC EyeGaze C API written by LC Technologies.

All the necessary files are already in your LC EyeGaze software directory, which
**must** be located at C:\EyeGaze on the computer you are running the ioHub software
on. This directory must also be in your system PATH so that the necesssary DLLs
and calibration.exe files can be found by the ioHub Process.

General Considerations
#######################

**Last Updated:** May 5th, 2013

Known Issues:              
==============

    #. Sample delay times are not being calculated correctly; therefore the sample time stamps themselves are not being correctly converted to ioHub time. Waiting for help from EyeGaze support contact to resolve this issue. Until resolved, time stamps of sample data are not going to be accurate at all.
    #. The eyetracker.runSetupProcedure() should be called 'before' creating the PsychoPy full screen window, otherwise the calibration screen may be blocked by the PsychoPy Window. This means that calibration can only be done at the start of the experiment.

Limitations:
==============

    #. The calibration window that appears when eyetracker.runSetupProcedure() is called can only be displayed on the primary monitor of a multimonitor setup. Please factor this into your monitor configuration.
    #. Currently only monocular EyeGaze systems in a single PC configuration have been tested and are known to work. If you have an Eye Follower system, or use a two computer setup, please contact me if you would like to help test and work with me to fix any issues with binocular or dual PC setups for the EyeGaze.

To Do / Wish List:
===================

    #. Add support for native file saving.
    #. Add support for calibration customization.
    #. Add support for Fixation parsing.
    #. Add support for 3D eye position data / vergence data.
