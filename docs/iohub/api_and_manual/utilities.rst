PsychoPy Coder *Extra's* API
==================================================

The iohub.util submodule of the ioHub Framework contains various classes and functions
that I have found useful when writing experiments using PsychoPy and the ioHub.
This section of the API is considered *experimental* and will be adjusted and
improved based on time as well as user feedback and suggestions.

..note:: This section, and subsections, of the manual and API is not fully 
    documented at this time. This will be fixed as time permits.
