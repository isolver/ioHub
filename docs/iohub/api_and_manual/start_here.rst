ioHub API Manual and Specification
####################################

This section of the documentation provides the information on
how to use the ioHub Event Framework and the ioHub
API details for parts of the ioHub Framework that an
end user of the ioHub may want to know about.


We do not cover *back-end* related API's that
are only of importance to a developer working on the ioHub 
source code, or creating a new Device class or Common Eye Tracker
Implementation.

**The ioHub Event Framework can be broken down into four areas based on the functionality provided.**
