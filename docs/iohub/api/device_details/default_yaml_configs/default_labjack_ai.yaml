# This section includes all valid labjack.AnalogInput Device
# settings that can be specified in an iohub_config.yaml
# or in a Python dictionary form and passed to the quickStartHubServer

# created by the ioHub Process will be assigned the default value

#
daq.hw.labjack.AnalogInput:
    
    # name: The unique name to assign to the device instance created.
    #   The device is accessed from within the PsychoPy script 
    #   using the name's value; therefore it must be a valid Python
    #   variable name as well.

    name: ain

    # model_name:The labjack.AnalogInput device model name is used to alter
    #   internal Device logic based on which version of the labjack
    #   device is going to be used. 
    #   Currently, only the U6 model is officially supported.
    #
    model_name: U6

    # monitor_event_types: Specify which of the device's supported event
    #   types you would like the ioHub to monitor for.
    #
    monitor_event_types: [MultiChannelAnalogInputEvent,]

    # channel_sampling_rate: The sampling rate, in Hz, of each of the eight
    #   analog input channels that are monitored. The channel_sampling_rate * 8
    #   equals the number of samples per second that the ioHub will 
    #   receive overall. Values between 125 and 1000 hz are suggested.
    #
    channel_sampling_rate: 1000

    # resolution_index: The resolution index to set the device to when aquiring
    #   the analog input signals. Please refer to your device's documentation 
    #   for a detailed explaination of what resolution_index does.
    #
    resolution_index: 1

    # settling_factor: The settling_factor to set the device to when aquiring
    #    the analog input signals. Please refer to your device's documentation
    #    for a detailed explaination of what settling_factor does.
    #
    settling_factor: 1

    # enable: Specifies if the device should be enabled by ioHub and monitored
    #   for events.
    #   True = Enable the device on the ioHub Server Process

    #   this device will be reported by the ioHub Server.

    enable: True

    # saveEvents: *If* the ioHubDataStore is enabled for the experiment, then
    #   indicate if events for this device should be saved to the
    #   data_collection/keyboard event group in the hdf5 event file.
    #   True = Save events for this device to the ioDataStore.
    #   False = Do not save events for this device in the ioDataStore.
    #    
    saveEvents: True

    # streamEvents: Indicate if events from this device should be made available
    #   during experiment runtime to the PsychoPy Process.
    #   True = Send events for this device to  the PsychoPy Process in real-time.
    #   False = Do *not* send events for this device to the PsychoPy Process in real-time.
    #    
    streamEvents: True

    # auto_report_events: Indicate if events from this device should start being
    #   processed by the ioHub as soon as the device is loaded at the start of an experiment,
    #   or if events should only start to be monitored on the device when a call to the
    #   device's enableEventReporting method is made with a parameter value of True.
    #   True = Automatically start reporting events for this device when the experiment starts.
    #   False = Do not start reporting events for this device until enableEventReporting(True)
    #   is set for the device during experiment runtime.
    #
    auto_report_events: False

    # event_buffer_length: Specify the maximum number of events (for each
    #   event type the device produces) that can be stored by the ioHub Server
    #   before each new event results in the oldest event of the same type being
    #   discarded from the ioHub device event buffer.
    #
    event_buffer_length: 1024

    # input_channel_count: The number of analog to digital channels to monitor
    #   in parrallel. Currently this value is fixed at 8 channels.
