This program will attempt to measure the noise of a provided signal on the U3.
This is good if there is ever a question of noise from the labjack or from a signal.

The experiment is performed by taking 128 readings in quick succession.
The results are then operated on the get the following values:

Peak-To-Peak Noise: The difference between the minimum and the maximum of the 128 values.
                    Since all readings should be the same, any variation is noise.

Noise Free Resolution (bits): This represents how many bits are noise free.

Noise Free Resolution (mV): The smallest value that can be represented noise free.

Connect your signal and run this program. After, connect something with an obviously
low noise signal ( like a battery ) and run the program. If you don't have a low-noise signal,
you can always jumper two FIO's to Ground and measure the noise as a differential.

You'll find that by comparing the two results, the labjack is rarely the reason for noisy readings.

On with the test:
