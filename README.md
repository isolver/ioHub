# ioHub

ioHub is not a complete experiment design and runtime API. It's main focus is on device event monitoring, 
real-time reporting, and persistant storage of input device events on a system wide basis. When ioHub is used
for experiment device monitoring during a psychopolgy or neuroscience type study, ioHub is designed to be used
with the most excellent [PsychoPy](http://www.psychopy.org). 

>> Note: **ioHub has merged with PsychoPy ( psychopy.iohub )**, so it can be used
>> out of the box with a PsychoPy installation, even if the desire is to use the ioHub event reporting
>> features in a 'headless' mode that does not create any windows or graphics. 
>> 
>> Please visit the [PsychoPy website](http://www.psychopy.org) for download and support options. 
>> 
>> This GitHub project will remain active so existing bugs and feature requests can continue to be tracked, 
>> and as a source for the latest non-psychopy integrated version of the code. This code base will not longer be 
>> updated. Future ioHub updates will be done within the PsychoPy GitHub project, in the psychopy.iohub submodule.
