# Experimental: sets the processors/cores/hyperthreads that the experiment process should run on.
# [] = all processors
# [0,1] = first and second processor/core/hyperthread.
# Note that on CPUs that support hyperthreading, each core will appear as 2 ( for the 2 hyperthreads on the core )
# I would 'suggest' that you do not bother trying to tie a process to a hyperthread, and only test at the CPU / core level.
# So for example, on an i5 Intel CPU with hypertheading and 2 cores, the list of 'available' processors would be [0,1,2,3]
# however in practice, you should only consider maybe putting the experiment process on core 1 = [0,1],
# and the ioHub process on core 2, = [2,3]. Whether this will improve or decrease performance is not clear yet.
# Support will; be available on Windows and Linux for sure. Mac TBD.
